this is my milestone project for the programming class i am enrolled in at UNLV!

it is my own very incomplete version of a space invaders/arcade fixed shooter type of game!

i decided to go with an ocean theme and for now it is only HTML, CSS, and JS but i do plan on keeping this project as i continue to learn to further improve it!
